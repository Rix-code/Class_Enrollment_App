# FINAL EXAM USING FLUTTER
In my Wireless Mobile Programming Final Exam, I decided to make  an Android Application including the Database with the following requirements:-- =>Features: register student, login, enrollment menu, select subject, enrollment summary (list of subjects and total credits) Additional: a max limit where total credits cannot more than x (i.e 24 credits)

I made an additional feature which can make the student to delete enrolled subject (this function is used if the user take the wrong subject)

A folder called Documentation of Exam contains the database used in this program and its using firebase
